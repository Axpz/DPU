# DPU

## Description
In the era of big data, Data Processing Units (DPUs) have gained significant attention, yet there remains a lack of in-depth understanding about them. This gap in knowledge motivates my project.  
As a firmware engineer for about ten years ago, I hadn’t encountered DPUs until recently. Time has passed, and while I may not fully grasp their complexities, I want to ensure I’m not left behind.

## Motivation
- Understand the fundamental principles of DPU architecture, not limited to them.
- Explore mainstream products and emerging development trends.
